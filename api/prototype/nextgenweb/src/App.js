                      UNDER TITLE XXI OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Section 2108(a) and Section 2108(e) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provide that each state and territory* 
                      must assess the operation of its state child health plan in each federal fiscal year and report to the Secretary, 
                      by January 1 following the end of the federal fiscal year, on the results of the assessment. 
                      In addition, this section of the Act provides that the state must assess the progress made in reducing the number 
                      of uncovered, low-income children.  The state is out of compliance with CHIP statute and regulations if the report 
                      is not submitted by January 1. The state is also out of compliance if any section of this report relevant to 
                      the stateâ€™s program is incomplete.
                    </p>
                    <p>The framework is designed to:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Recognize the <b>diversity</b> of state approaches to CHIP and allow states <b>flexibility</b> to highlight key 
                      accomplishments and progress of their CHIP programs, <b>AND</b></li>
                      <li>Provide <b>consistency</b> across states in the structure, content, and format of the report, <b>AND</b></li>
                      <li>Build on data <b>already collected</b> by CMS quarterly enrollment and expenditure reports, <b>AND</b></li>
                      <li>Enhance <b>accessibility</b> of information to stakeholders on the achievements under Title XXI</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The CHIP Annual Report Template System (CARTS) is organized as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Section I: Snapshot of CHIP Programs and Changes</li>
                      <li>Section II: Program's Performance Measurement and Progress</li>
                      <li>Section III: Assessment of State Plan and Program Operation</li>
                      <li>Section IV: Program Financing for State Plan</li>
                      <li>Section V: Program Challenges and Accomplishments</li>
                    </ul>
